# MIPS Assembly Tasks Repository

## Overview
This repository contains **MIPS Assembly Language tasks** from my **1st semester**, covering fundamental concepts and practical exercises. The collection serves as a **valuable resource for beginners** looking to gain a better understanding of MIPS assembly programming. These tasks provide hands-on experience with **register operations, arithmetic computations, memory handling, branching, and subroutines**.

## Why This Repository?
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Designed to help newcomers get started with MIPS Assembly.
- **Practical Exercises**: Covers core assembly language concepts.
- **Step-by-Step Learning**: Tasks build upon one another for progressive learning.
- **Hands-On Practice**: Helps develop problem-solving skills in low-level programming.

## Contents
The repository includes a variety of tasks that explore different aspects of **MIPS Assembly** programming:

### 1. Basic Arithmetic Operations
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- Working with immediate values and registers.

### 2. Logical Operations
- Bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.
- Shifting (Logical and Arithmetic shifts).

### 3. Memory and Addressing
- Loading and Storing values using `lw` and `sw`.
- Understanding **stack operations**.

### 4. Branching and Looping
- Conditional branching with `beq`, `bne`, `slt`, etc.
- Loop structures like **for-loops, while-loops, and do-while-loops**.

### 5. Subroutines and Functions
- Implementing functions using `jal`, `jr`, and `ra`.
- Parameter passing via registers.

### 6. Array and String Handling
- Working with arrays using index-based access.
- String manipulation using ASCII values.

### 7. System Calls and I/O
- Reading input and printing output using **syscalls**.
- Handling integer and string inputs.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **MIPS Simulator**: Install **MARS** or **SPIM** to run MIPS assembly programs.
- **Basic Understanding of Assembly Language** (Recommended).

### How to Use
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HopzAlot/MIPS
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```sh
   cd MIPS-Tasks
   ```
3. **Open the MIPS simulator (MARS or SPIM)** and load any `.asm` file.
4. **Run the program** by assembling and executing it step-by-step.
